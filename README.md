# Electrical Active Filters

In this implementation we design the following filters:
- **LowPass Inverse Chebychev Filter**
- **HihPass Butterworth Filter**
- **BandPass Chebyshev Filter**
- **BandElimination Chebyshev Filter**

In the beginning of the codes we define the standards, the band of frequences and the gain of each filter.
